## Description

Do you listen to a lot of mixes on Youtube? Perhaps you are a EDM nerd and love listening to hourlong mixes. Perhaps you found one you really enjoyed, and would love to have them all in a Spotify playlist.

tracklist2spotify was born out of necessity, as the act of manually parsing those long inconsistent tracklists from video descriptions and searching for each track in Spotify was very tedious. This projects aims to mitigate this frustration by doing everything automatically, behind the scenes.

By pasting in a tracklist and applying some customizable regex, users can generate Spotify links to each track. Furthermore, if they want to add any of the tracks (or all of them) to an existing or a new playlist, they can do so.
